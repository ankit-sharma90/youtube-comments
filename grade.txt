Notes: Nice work. The app works well and the UI is easy to use,and you've correctly identified ways to take it further. 7 point deduction for scope because it doesn't do much beyond fetch the top 5 comments by category and display them. I'd love to see a way for clients to say how many comments they'd like to see or otherwise control what they're looking for. 7 points deducted for scope being mostly already covered in class.
